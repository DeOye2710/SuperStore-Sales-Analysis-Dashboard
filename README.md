üß† Personal Note:
This project represents one of my most in-depth Excel analyses as at the time i did it months back.
It reflects my ability to combine technical data analytics skills (data cleaning, modeling, EDA, dashboarding) with business storytelling, turning raw sales data into a dynamic and professional business intelligence report.
It also reflects where i was then and where i am now.
